Communication has been the essence of life from the beginning of time with the evolution of technology, mode, and style.

In the early days, conversations were restricted to verbal and textual interaction between humans. These interactions are usually guided by emotions, context, and awareness of previous conversations. Following the innovation of computers, interactions have now expanded to include machines i.e. human-machine interactions. The transitions from a command-based interface to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a Conversational User Interface (CUI) became natural and need-based making communication easier.

Further enhancements using Artificial Intelligence and NLP capabilities enabled Virtual Assistants to understand user utterances in the natural language; derive the task from the user utterance as well as extract the information required to successfully execute the task.

AI-driven, NLP-based chat, and voice virtual assistants are the latest in technology and a must for all businesses in this generation.

## What are Conversational Virtual Assistants?

A Conversational Virtual Assistant acts as an intelligent intermediary between people, digital systems, and internet-enabled things. It replaces the traditional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) of an application or website with a Conversational User Interface. It is a paradigm shift from the earlier communications achieved either by entering syntax-specific commands or clicking icons.

Virtual Assistants are designed to converse with users through a combination of natural language-based conversations. Responses can come in the form of buttons, calendars, or other widgets that accelerate the speed with which a user can respond.

AI-powered messaging solutions or Conversational Virtual Assistants serve as the stepping stone to the future. It communicates through intelligent virtual agents, organizations’ apps and websites, social media platforms, and messenger platforms. Users can interact with such assistants using voice or text to access information, complete tasks, and execute transactions.

So what makes the Conversational Virtual Assistant so special? In a nutshell:

## What are Intents & Entities?

A conversational virtual assistant faces three challenges:
1 **Intent** Detection – Understanding what the user wants.
2 **Entity** Extraction – Extracting the required information from the user to accomplish what the user wants.
3 **Dialog Flow/Conversation**  – Accomplishing the user wants.
