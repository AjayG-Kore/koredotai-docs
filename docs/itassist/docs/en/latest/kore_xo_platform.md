Communication has been the essence of life from the beginning of time with the evolution of technology, mode, and style.

In the early days, conversations were restricted to verbal and textual interaction between humans. These interactions are usually guided by emotions, context, and awareness of previous conversations. Following the innovation of computers, interactions have now expanded to include machines i.e. human-machine interactions. The transitions from a command-based interface to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a Conversational User Interface (CUI) became natural and need-based making communication easier.

Further enhancements using Artificial Intelligence and NLP capabilities enabled Virtual Assistants to understand user utterances in the natural language; derive the task from the user utterance as well as extract the information required to successfully execute the task.

AI-driven, NLP-based chat, and voice virtual assistants are the latest in technology and a must for all businesses in this generation.

## What are Conversational Virtual Assistants?

A Conversational Virtual Assistant acts as an intelligent intermediary between people, digital systems, and internet-enabled things. It replaces the traditional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) of an application or website with a Conversational User Interface. It is a paradigm shift from the earlier communications achieved either by entering syntax-specific commands or clicking icons.

Virtual Assistants are designed to converse with users through a combination of natural language-based conversations. Responses can come in the form of buttons, calendars, or other widgets that accelerate the speed with which a user can respond.

AI-powered messaging solutions or Conversational Virtual Assistants serve as the stepping stone to the future. It communicates through intelligent virtual agents, organizations’ apps and websites, social media platforms, and messenger platforms. Users can interact with such assistants using voice or text to access information, complete tasks, and execute transactions.

So what makes the Conversational Virtual Assistant so special? In a nutshell:

## What are Intents & Entities?

A conversational virtual assistant faces three challenges:

1 **Intent** Detection – Understanding what the user wants.

2 **Entity** Extraction – Extracting the required information from the user to accomplish what the user wants.

3 **Dialog Flow/Conversation**  – Accomplishing the user wants.

Whatever the user says is considered as an **Utterance**. It is the task of the Conversational VA to extract the intent, and entities essential to carry a conversation from the user utterance. For example, let us consider the following user utterance: I want to fly to London this weekend.

An **Intent** is the user’s intention that usually comes in the form of a verb or noun within the user utterance. From the above user utterance, a Conversational VA understands the user intent as want to fly and triggers the corresponding dialog task.

**Entities** are a collection of data or information that the VA requires to complete the task which is identified in the user intent. There can be multiple entities in various formats that are required by the VA. These can either be a part of user utterance or the VA needs to prompt the user for the entity values. For example, in the above user utterance, London, and this weekend form the values for the entities representing **Destination** and **Travel Date** respectively. As you can notice, the Source entity value is missing and the Bot needs to prompt the user for the same.

As seen, an Entity can be of any type like location, date, time, person, etc,.
